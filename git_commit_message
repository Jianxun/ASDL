feat(scripts): update netlist_asdl.py to modern ASDL pipeline

Updates the command-line netlist generation script to use the new
Elaborator-based pipeline instead of the deprecated PatternExpander.

## Changes

### Pipeline Modernization
- Replace PatternExpander import with Elaborator
- Update parser result handling for tuple return (ASDLFile, diagnostics)
- Fix type handling for auto-generated output filenames
- Update step descriptions: "expand" → "elaborate"

### Robust Error Handling
- Handle parser diagnostics reporting
- Handle elaboration diagnostics reporting  
- Validate None returns from parser/elaborator
- Improved error messages for pipeline failures

### Functionality Verified
- Tested with diff_pair_nmos.yml (complex circuit with pattern expansion)
- Auto-filename generation working (@filename syntax)
- Verbose output shows complete pipeline statistics
- Generated SPICE identical to integration test quality

## Results
- Script fully functional with modern ASDL architecture ✅
- All CLI features preserved and enhanced ✅  
- End-to-end YAML → SPICE conversion working ✅

The netlist script now provides a complete command-line interface
for the modernized ASDL toolchain.
