# Handoff

## Current state
- Contract and codebase map updated for xDSL refactor direction and ordering-as-lists rule; legacy `context/todo_*.md` frozen until post-refactor tasks are defined; legacy `.cursor/rules` removed (agents/ context is now the single source).

## Last verified status
- Context files present; no automated checks.

## Next steps (1–3)
1. Define xDSL refactor task board entries (new tasks only; do not migrate legacy todos yet).
2. Decide which lessons/ADRs to record from `agents/scratchpads/xDSL_refactor.md`.

## Risks / unknowns
- Legacy todos may become obsolete; ensure new tasks reflect the xDSL architecture before migration.
