# Tasks Archived

## 2026-01-01
- T-020 | Status: Done | Owner: Executor | DoD: Rename core xDSL dialect to `asdl_cir` in code/tests; update converter usage and IR text expectations to match ASDL_CIR naming; keep semantics unchanged. | Verify: `pytest tests/unit_tests/ir`. | Links: scratchpad `agents/scratchpads/T-020_cir_rename.md`, PR https://github.com/Jianxun/ASDL/pull/24. | Completion: 2026-01-01.
- T-021 | Status: Done | Owner: Executor | DoD: Rewrite ASDL_A AST + parser for net-first explicit schema (explicit instances/nets only; no pattern sugar/imports/exports/inline binds); ports inferred only from `$` net keys; add parser/AST tests for MVP constraints. | Verify: `pytest tests/unit_tests/parser`. | Links: scratchpad `agents/scratchpads/T-021_ast_net_first_mvp.md`, PR https://github.com/Jianxun/ASDL/pull/25. | Completion: 2026-01-01.
- T-010 | Status: Done | Owner: Executor | DoD: Implement Pydantic v2 AST models aligned with `docs/specs/spec_ast.md` (AsdlDocument, ModuleDecl, ViewDecl union by kind, SubcktRef/Dummy/Behav, ParamValue); enforce AST hard requirements (non-empty templates, dummy name/kind coupling, conns mapping); add `model_json_schema` export; add focused unit tests for validation edge cases. | Verify: `pytest tests/unit_tests/ast`. | Links: scratchpad `agents/scratchpads/T-010_ast_pydantic.md`. | Completion: 2026-01-01.
- T-011 | Status: Done | Owner: Executor | DoD: Build YAML parser using ruamel -> plain dict -> Pydantic validation; implement LocationIndex to map YAML paths to Locatable; map Pydantic ValidationError into `Diagnostic` with correct locations; update parser API (`parse_file`/`parse_string`) to return AST + diagnostics; add location-mapping tests. | Verify: `pytest tests/unit_tests/parser`. | Links: scratchpad `agents/scratchpads/T-011_parser_locatable.md`, PR https://github.com/Jianxun/ASDL/pull/20. | Completion: 2026-01-01.
- T-012 | Status: Done (Pre-rename; superseded by T-020) | Owner: Executor | DoD: Implement xDSL `asdl_cir` dialect ops/attrs per `docs/specs/spec_asdl_cir.md` with verifiers; update AST->IR converter to emit `asdl_cir.design/module/view/...` and enforce canonical `nominal` during emission; add unit tests (skip if xdsl optional dep missing). | Verify: `pytest tests/unit_tests/ir`. | Links: scratchpad `agents/scratchpads/T-012_ir_dialect_converter.md`, PR https://github.com/Jianxun/ASDL/pull/21. | Completion: 2026-01-01.
- T-016 | Status: Done | Owner: Executor | DoD: Implement diagnostic core types (Diagnostic, Severity, SourceSpan, Label, Note, FixIt), a collector sink, and text/JSON renderers with deterministic ordering. | Verify: `pytest tests/unit_tests/diagnostics`. | Links: scratchpad `agents/scratchpads/T-016_diagnostic_core.md`, PR https://github.com/Jianxun/ASDL/pull/19. | Completion: 2026-01-01.
- T-001 | Status: Done (Superseded by T-010) | Owner: Architect | DoD: ADR-0001 reflected in schema plan; draft schema/pydantic shape for views with reserved kinds (subckt, subckt_ref, primitive, dummy) and reserved names (nominal/nom, dummy); confirm ordering decision (lists where order matters) for view substructures; file updates staged for review (schema draft or design doc). | Verify: none (design task). | Links: ADR-0001, scratchpad `agents/scratchpads/ASDL_schema_refactor.md`. | Completion: 2026-01-01.
- T-002 | Status: Done (Superseded by T-010) | Owner: Architect | DoD: Define data model/spec for view payloads by kind (fields for subckt, subckt_ref/PEX mapping, primitive/spice_template, dummy) and document validation expectations (validate all views as if used); update scratchpad with field tables and invariants. | Verify: none (design task). | Links: ADR-0001, scratchpad `agents/scratchpads/ASDL_schema_refactor.md`. | Completion: 2026-01-01.
- T-003 | Status: Done (Superseded by T-013) | Owner: Architect | DoD: Specify and design the SelectView compiler pass; selection runs after config/view_order application; pass validates all views as if they will be used; outputs resolved (module, view) mapping and diagnostics strategy; update scratchpad with pass contract and verify plan. | Verify: none (design task). | Links: ADR-0001, scratchpad `agents/scratchpads/ASDL_schema_refactor.md`. | Completion: 2026-01-01.
