# OKRs

## Current Sprint (MVP)
Objective: Deliver the minimal ASDL pipeline from authoring AST to ngspice emission.

Key Results
- KR1: ASDL_NFIR dialect + AST->NFIR conversion implemented with unit tests.
- KR2: ASDL_IFIR dialect + NFIR->IFIR conversion implemented with unit tests.
- KR3: ngspice emitter from IFIR implemented with param validation and golden tests.
- KR4: End-to-end MVP pipeline test (AST -> NFIR -> IFIR -> emit) is deterministic.

Status: Not started.
