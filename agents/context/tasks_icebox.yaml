    title: Backend lowering refactor
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Refactor backend lowering to separate verification from
      rendering/emission; reduce overly defensive checks in render paths now
      covered by verification. Focus on readability and single-pass flow
      without changing netlist output or diagnostics semantics.

    title: Exports sugar
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Add `exports` sugar to AST and lowering: allow `exports` block in modules
      and forward child ports into parent nets per `docs/specs/spec_ast.md`.
      Include diagnostics for invalid forwarding; no changes to IFIR
      semantics beyond expanded nets.

    title: Pipeline IR dump hooks
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Add debug options to the MVP pipeline to dump NFIR/IFIR/atomized IFIR
      modules to text for inspection. Support selecting stages and directing
      output to a dump directory or callback; ensure dumps are emitted even when
      verify is disabled. Add unit tests that run the pipeline on a small fixture
      and assert the dump outputs exist and include expected op headers.

    title: CLI IR dump options
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Add asdlc netlist flags to dump NFIR/IFIR/atomized IFIR to disk
      (for example, --dump-ir nfir,ifir,atom and --dump-dir). Use pipeline
      debug hooks to emit dumps next to the output file by default. Update CLI
      help text and document file naming conventions.

    title: Preserve AST location spans
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Preserve detailed AST locations for downstream diagnostics by retaining a
      LocationIndex (or equivalent lookup helper) on the parsed document and
      exposing key spans for module/device/patterns/instance_defaults entries.
      Add unit tests that assert key and list-item spans for a fixture covering
      modules, devices, patterns, instance_defaults, nets, and instances.

    title: Add minimal AST token validation
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Add minimal AST validation for endpoint tokens and instance expressions:
      endpoint strings must contain exactly one '.' with non-empty instance and
      pin segments and no whitespace; instance expressions must include a model
      token and optional key=value tokens with non-empty key/value segments.
      Extend parser/AST tests to cover invalid tokens with precise diagnostics.
