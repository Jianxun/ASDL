    title: Backend lowering refactor
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Refactor backend lowering to separate verification from
      rendering/emission; reduce overly defensive checks in render paths now
      covered by verification. Focus on readability and single-pass flow
      without changing netlist output or diagnostics semantics.
    verify:
      - pytest tests/unit_tests/emit -v
      - pytest tests/unit_tests/netlist -v

    title: Exports sugar
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Add `exports` sugar to AST and lowering: allow `exports` block in modules
      and forward child ports into parent nets per `docs/specs/spec_ast.md`.
      Include diagnostics for invalid forwarding; no changes to IFIR
      semantics beyond expanded nets.

      - pytest tests/unit_tests/ast -v
      - pytest tests/unit_tests/ir -v

    title: Pipeline IR dump hooks
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Add debug options to the MVP pipeline to dump NFIR/IFIR/atomized IFIR
      modules to text for inspection. Support selecting stages and directing
      output to a dump directory or callback; ensure dumps are emitted even when
      verify is disabled. Add unit tests that run the pipeline on a small fixture
      and assert the dump outputs exist and include expected op headers.
    verify:
      - pytest tests/unit_tests/e2e/test_pipeline_mvp.py -v

    title: CLI IR dump options
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Add asdlc netlist flags to dump NFIR/IFIR/atomized IFIR to disk
      (for example, --dump-ir nfir,ifir,atom and --dump-dir). Use pipeline
      debug hooks to emit dumps next to the output file by default. Update CLI
      help text and document file naming conventions.
