    title: Backend lowering refactor
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Refactor backend lowering to separate verification from
      rendering/emission; reduce overly defensive checks in render paths now
      covered by verification. Focus on readability and single-pass flow
      without changing netlist output or diagnostics semantics.
    verify:
      - pytest tests/unit_tests/emit -v
      - pytest tests/unit_tests/netlist -v

    title: Exports sugar
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Add `exports` sugar to AST and lowering: allow `exports` block in modules
      and forward child ports into parent nets per `docs/specs/spec_ast.md`.
      Include diagnostics for invalid forwarding; no changes to IFIR
      semantics beyond expanded nets.
    verify:
      - pytest tests/unit_tests/ast -v
      - pytest tests/unit_tests/ir -v
