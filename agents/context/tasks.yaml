    title: Add stateless verifiers for AtomizedGraph
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Add pure verification helpers for the atomized core graph that validate
      unique net/instance names, endpoint references, and endpoint ports against
      module/device ports lists in the atomized program. Verifier diagnostics
      must use distinct codes from PatternedGraph atomization, and verifier
      execution should be gated at the caller level so it only runs when
      atomization produced no error diagnostics. Define diagnostic codes used by
      the verifiers and add unit tests.
