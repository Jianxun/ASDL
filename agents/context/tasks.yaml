    title: GraphIR to AST normalized output
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Add a GraphIR -> AST normalized serializer that emits explicit nets and
      instances without authoring sugar. Include roundtrip tests that parse,
      lower to GraphIR, and re-emit AST with deterministic ordering.
    verify:
      - venv/bin/pytest tests/unit_tests/ast -v
    files:
      - src/asdl/ir/converters/graphir_to_ast.py
      - src/asdl/ast/models.py

    title: Named pattern substitution in GraphIR path
    owner: Architect
    dod: >
      Decide where named pattern substitution belongs in the GraphIR pipeline
      (AST parse, AST->GraphIR conversion, or a dedicated pass), record the
      decision in contract/ADR if needed, and note migration implications.
    verify:
      - rg -n "Named pattern substitution" agents/context/contract.md agents/adr

exploration_candidates:
  - IFIR diagnostics spans: mapping strategy, edge cases, and test fixtures.
  - CLI pipeline UX: command flow, error messaging, and file layout.
  - Netlist emission validation: strictness vs warnings; validation stages.
  - xDSL pipeline boundaries: pass split/merge opportunities and IR boundaries.
  - Codebase map gaps: navigation audit for future Executors.
