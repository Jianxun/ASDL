    title: Scope symbol sidecar generation/editor workflow
    owner: Architect
    dod: >
      Provide a short proposal for generating and editing .sym.yaml files,
      including whether to reuse the schematic visualizer (single-node mode)
      or create a dedicated symbol editor. Identify the minimal UI/actions
      needed to create/update symbols, how glyphs are positioned, and any
      required schema changes or new commands.

    title: Parse project manifest v1 + library expansion
    owner: Executor
    dod: >
      Update the Sphinx ASDL domain to parse the v1 project manifest schema
      (schema_version, project_name, readme, docs, entrances, libraries)
      while preserving YAML list order. Library entries must expand all
      .asdl files under each library root, honoring exclude globs relative
      to the library root (no implicit filtering). Remove legacy manifest
      entry sorting/expansion from the project flow. Add unit coverage for
      parsing and exclude handling.

    title: Render project nav page (README/docs/entrances/libraries)

    depends_on:
      - T-272
    dod: >
      Generate a project nav page that orders entries as README, docs,
      entrances, then libraries. README label uses project_name when set,
      otherwise the document title. Entrances must render file+module
      references with descriptions. Update the example Sphinx index to
      include only the generated project page (no duplicate README entry).
      Add unit coverage for nav ordering and entrance link rendering.
