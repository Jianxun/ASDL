# Project Status

Brief context record for the Architect; reconcile from task status and reviews.

## Current state
- ASDL docs pipeline is focused on Sphinx (Tier 2); Markdown generation is deprecated.
- Comment-based docstring extraction is implemented per ADR-0021 and feeds Sphinx rendering.
- Doc rendering targets per-file `asdl:document` pages plus project-level manifest wiring.
- Dependency graph support is the active enabler for instance cross-links and "Used by" sections.

## Last verified status
- `venv/bin/pytest tests/unit_tests/ast`
- `venv/bin/pytest tests/unit_tests/ir`
- `venv/bin/pytest tests/unit_tests/parser`
- `venv/bin/pytest tests/unit_tests/emit -v`
- `venv/bin/pytest tests/unit_tests/netlist`
- `venv/bin/pytest tests/unit_tests/e2e`
- `venv/bin/pytest tests/unit_tests/cli`
- `venv/bin/pytest tests/unit_tests/ir tests/unit_tests/netlist`
- `venv/bin/python -m py_compile src/asdl/emit/netlist/*.py`

## Next steps (1-3)
1. T-259: Align Sphinx document structure with file/module semantics.

## Risks / unknowns
- Module name collisions across files must be disambiguated in tooling without exposing hash IDs to users.
- Sphinx link resolution depends on depgraph completeness; unresolved refs should degrade gracefully.
- Sphinx docs builds currently miss `.asdlrc` lib roots unless explicitly wired, leading to AST-010 import errors.
- Manifest auto-expansion must avoid non-deterministic ordering and duplicates across entry imports.
