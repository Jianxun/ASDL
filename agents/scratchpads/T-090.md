# Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD: Add atomization helpers in `src/asdl/patterns.py` that expand a pattern token into single-atom pattern tokens with emitted literal names and origin metadata, including base-less patterns. Provide endpoint atomization helpers and diagnostics for malformed tokens. Add parser-level unit tests for atomization outputs and error cases.
- Verify: `pytest tests/unit_tests/parser/test_pattern_atomization.py -v`
