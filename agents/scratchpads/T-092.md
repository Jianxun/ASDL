# T-092 Netlist emission assumes atomized IFIR

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- Remove pattern elaboration from netlist emission and update netlist tests to rely on atomized IFIR output.
- Replace or retire pattern elaboration tests as needed and add coverage to ensure emit-time does not expand patterns.
- Verify with: `pytest tests/unit_tests/netlist/test_netlist_emitter.py -v`.
