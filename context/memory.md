# Project Memory

## Project Overview
ASDL (Analog System Description Language) is a comprehensive Python framework for analog circuit design and verification. The project provides parsing, elaboration, validation, and SPICE netlist generation capabilities with a focus on hierarchical design and test-driven development.

## Current State
**Major Milestone Completed: ASDL Visualization Prototype Development**

### ‚úÖ **Recently Completed (Previous Session) - VISUALIZATION FRONTEND MILESTONE**
- **üéâ COMPLETE FRONTEND VISUALIZATION SYSTEM**: Successfully delivered Phase 1: Static Schematic Renderer with production-ready quality
- **jsPlumb Integration**: Resolved API version conflicts, implemented Community Edition 2.15.6 with orthogonal-style Flowchart connectors
- **Professional UI Architecture**: Three-panel layout (header, sidebar, canvas) with responsive design and modern gradient styling
- **Circuit Rendering Pipeline**: Full JSON loading ‚Üí node creation ‚Üí connection drawing ‚Üí interactive visualization
- **Component Styling System**: NMOS (blue), PMOS (pink), Resistor (orange) with pattern indicators and hover effects
- **Connection Visualization**: Flowchart connectors with arrows, labels, differential/single-ended distinction, rounded corners
- **Interactive Features**: Draggable nodes, hover effects, coordinate tracking, circuit statistics, net information display
- **Repository Integration**: Committed to 'visualization' branch with comprehensive documentation and clean code structure
- **Demo-Ready**: HTTP server tested, diff_pair.json renders perfectly, end-to-end pipeline validated
- **üóÉÔ∏è ARCHIVED**: Verbose implementation (698 lines) archived as reference in `prototype/visualization/archive/`

### ‚úÖ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE - MINIMAL VISUALIZER FOUNDATION**
- **Architecture Achievement**: Successfully implemented minimal functional architecture with jsPlumb Community Edition 2.15.6
- **Core Functionality**: Cursor-centered zoom (0.1x-3.0x), smooth canvas panning, invisible grid-snap dragging (20px)
- **Technical Implementation**: Two-layer container architecture, manual zoom/pan for Community Edition, proper event conflict resolution
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive `jsplumb_development_guide.md` with 350+ lines of patterns, pitfalls, and best practices
- **Ready for Phase 2**: Solid foundation for circuit node rendering from JSON data

### üîß **Current Status**
- **Test Suite**: 82/82 tests passing (70 non-generator + 6 validator + 2 generator pipeline + 4 removed, now 8 integration tests) ‚úÖ
- **Integration Tests**: 8/8 passing (2 generator pipeline + 6 inverter simulation) ‚úÖ
- **NgSpice Simulations**: Clean execution with no errors or warnings ‚úÖ
- **CLI Tools**: netlist_asdl.py script with enhanced diagnostic reporting - fully functional ‚úÖ
- **Visualization Pipeline**: extractor.py script - fully functional and tested ‚úÖ
- **Error Reporting**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - Line/column information in all error messages
- **Generator Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY RESTORED & COMPREHENSIVELY TESTED** - Complete refactoring successful
- **Device Models**: ‚úÖ **PROFESSIONAL GRADE** - Fully parameterized with realistic PDK expressions

### üìä **Component Health**
- ‚úÖ **Parser**: 23/23 tests passing - Complete location tracking and diagnostics (with known YAML pattern parsing limitation)
- ‚úÖ **Data Structures**: 34/34 tests passing - All refactoring completed  
- ‚úÖ **Elaborator**: 13/13 tests passing - Complete pattern expansion system
- ‚úÖ **Validator**: 6/6 tests passing - Complete validation pipeline
- ‚úÖ **SPICEGenerator**: 2/2 integration tests passing - Complete modernization successful
- ‚úÖ **Visualization Extractor**: Manual testing complete - Ready for frontend development

## Key Decisions
1. **Validation Architecture**: Explicit validation step with ASDLValidator class, easy to integrate or hide
2. **Error Handling**: Validator warns/errors, generator continues resilient generation
3. **TDD Approach**: All validation methods implemented incrementally with tests first
4. **Clean Separation**: Complete removal of validation logic from generator (214 lines removed)
5. **Legacy Code Removal**: Removed all backward compatibility and legacy validation code as requested
6. **Visualization Strategy**: Pre-elaboration data extraction to preserve high-level design abstractions like differential pairs
7. **Parser Workaround**: Multi-line YAML format for mappings containing patterns to avoid ruamel.yaml parsing bugs
8. **jsPlumb Edition Choice**: Use Community Edition 2.15.6 with manual zoom/pan implementation vs commercial Toolkit
9. **Container Architecture**: Two-layer viewport/content pattern essential for proper zoom/pan behavior
10. **Event Handling**: Pan detection must exclude draggable elements to avoid jsPlumb conflicts

## Open Questions
1. **Integration Strategy**: How to integrate validator into the main pipeline (before generation)
2. **Data Structure Fixes**: Need to fix DeviceModel compatibility in generator
3. **Pipeline Testing**: Need end-to-end tests with validator + generator integration
4. **Visualization Phase 2**: Implement circuit node rendering from JSON data with named ports (G/S/D/B)
5. **Connection System**: Implement UUID-based port-to-port connections using Flowchart connectors

## Compiler Improvement Notes
- **Parser Robustness**: The `ASDLParser` crashed when a `model` was missing the `type` field. It should instead produce a user-friendly error (e.g., `P104: Missing 'type' in model definition`).
- **Elaborator Robustness**: The `Elaborator` crashed with a `'NoneType' is not iterable` error when an `instance` was missing a `parameters` block. It should handle this gracefully and produce a specific error code (e.g., `E201: Instance missing required 'parameters' block`). These internal errors make debugging difficult.
- **YAML Pattern Parsing Bug**: `ruamel.yaml` incorrectly parses inline dictionary mappings containing `<p,n>` patterns, creating malformed dictionaries. Workaround: use multi-line YAML format for all mappings with patterns. This should be documented as a known limitation.
