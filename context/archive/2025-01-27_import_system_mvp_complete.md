# Import System MVP Implementation - COMPLETED (2025-01-27)

## Phase 1.2: Complete - Import System MVP Implementation

### **Import System as Elaborator Phase**: All 6 core components implemented, tested, and integrated
- **Component Placement**: Parser extensions in `sections/`, elaborator extensions in `elaborator/import_/`
- **Error Code Strategy**: P05xx for parser syntax validation, E044x for elaborator reference resolution
- **MVP Error Codes**: P0503, E0441-E0445 implemented with comprehensive diagnostics
- **Orchestrator Complete**: ImportResolver with circular import detection and workflow coordination

### **Completed Systems**
- **Phase 1.1 Import Data Structures**: ASDLFile with model_alias field, simplified imports (Commit: 9d3bc9e)
- **Phase 1.2.1 Parser Extensions**: model_alias_parser.py with P0503 validation (Commit: 15d8040)
- **Phase 1.2.2 Import Infrastructure**: path_resolver.py + file_loader.py with caching/circular detection (Commit: 15d8040)
- **Phase 1.2.3 Reference Resolution**: module_resolver.py + alias_resolver.py + diagnostics.py (Commit: 5fcb92a)
- **Phase 1.2.4 Orchestrator**: import_resolver.py main coordinator with circular import fix (Commit: 06cfbb1)
- **Testing**: 41 import system tests passing (100% success rate) including orchestrator and parser extensions

### **Phase 1.2.4 Completed (2025-08-24)**

### **Import System MVP Complete - Production Ready**
- **All 6 Core Components**: Fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage
- **Import Orchestrator**: Main workflow coordinator with recursive loading and flattening
- **Circular Import Fix**: Critical cache bypass bug fixed - moved circular check before cache lookup
- **Test Coverage**: 41 tests passing including orchestrator scenarios and edge cases
- **Error Handling**: Complete E0442 diagnostic generation with proper cycle description
- **Examples**: Working test cases in `examples/imports/` for debugging and validation

### **Key Architectural Achievement**
- **Two-Layer Circular Detection**: FileLoader (individual files) + ImportResolver (workflow orchestration)
- **Robust Error Recovery**: Graceful failure with clear diagnostics, continues processing other imports
- **Module Flattening**: Single output ASDLFile with all dependencies resolved and modules combined
- **Search Path Resolution**: Full ASDL_PATH support with fallback to project-relative paths

### **Phase 1.2.5 (2025-08-24)**

### **Orchestration Phase 0 Skeleton Integrated + CLI Import Resolution**
- Added `Elaborator.elaborate_with_imports(main_file_path, search_paths=None, top=None)` to orchestrate: import resolution → pattern expansion → variable resolution
- Updated CLI commands:
  - `elaborate`: resolves imports first; supports `--search-path` for resolution
  - `netlist`: resolves imports first; supports `--search-path`; runs validate → generator as before
- Import flattening normalizes instance `model` references:
  - Strips qualified prefixes (`alias.module` → `module`)
  - Applies `model_alias` to bind to local module names before downstream phases
- Added toy example under `examples/imports/toy` and verified end-to-end netlisting to `examples/imports/toy/top.spice`

### **Phase 1.2.6 (2025-08-25)**
- Implemented post-load validation for qualified instance references:
  - **E0444** Unknown import alias
  - **E0443** Module not found in imported file
- Added quality warnings:
  - **I0601** Unused import alias
  - **I0602** Unused model alias
- Enhanced **E0441** details to include explicit probe paths.
- Updated CLI `netlist` to skip generation when any ERROR diagnostics exist (prevents runtime exceptions and surfaces diagnostics).
- Added unit tests for E0443/E0444 and probe paths; scaffolded CLI integration test for toy example.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Production Ready
- All core components implemented and tested
- 41 import system tests passing (100% success rate)
- Circular import detection and recovery working
- CLI integration complete with search path support
- End-to-end pipeline validated with toy examples
