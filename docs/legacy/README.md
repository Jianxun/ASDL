# Legacy Docs

This directory holds decommissioned xDSL-era specifications and pipeline notes
(GraphIR/IFIR/NFIR and the legacy compiler stack). These documents are retained
for historical reference only and do not describe the current refactor
pipeline, which is based on PatternedGraph/AtomizedGraph/NetlistIR.

For active specs, see `docs/specs/` and `docs/specs_refactor/`.
